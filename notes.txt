DISCO
- Using ArrayList methods in our wrapper class allows us to write methods more efficiently. 
- Binary search allows us to find the proper index to add at faster than linear search does for larger ArrayLists
- Creating a temporary variable to store the "status" of a method allows us to write methods without using the `break` keyword or altering the returnType of a method.
- This unaltering of the returnType allows us to better utilize interfaces to organize methods.
